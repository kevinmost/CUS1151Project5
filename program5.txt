program 5 
element type positive int or 0

binary search tree
use insert algorithm
create tree using positive integers
in order traversal of tree
after creating, print out the order that each integer is hit in binary search fashion


write two algorithms for this program and put them in main
	treenodecount
	treeleafcount

delete a node
do another in order traversal to show node has been deleted. use another binary search tree




given first line of main
binary tree.h 
binary search tree.h 
pure virtual situation 


base class of binary tree 
	these are public
	tree node count
	tree leaves count
need to call them from main (public ones) to get to private ones
use these names and need to implement these (WRITE YOUR OWN):
	leaf count{}
	node count{}


write the main 
given base and derived class
no imp files



int main psearchtree type

create tree using insert called tree root (10 or 12 nums)
stop loop by typing in 999

run the in-order-traversal

treeroot.inordertraversal
	goes along each node and prints out all the numbers
	prints out as a binary search tree
	number of nodes = (tree node count) write own algorithm
	number of leaves = (tree leaf count) write private version

	treeroot.search(number) returns true or false if number is in tree or not
	.deletenode(node) 
	.inordertraversal 2nd time (`without the deleted node)


assume
